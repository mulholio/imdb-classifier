# IMDB Classifier

This project contains a Jupyter Notebook which trains a model to categorise IMDB movie reviews into positive and negative sentiment.

It uses the ULMFiT approach, [spelled out in this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06146), to reach an accuracy of 94.4% on the [Large Movie Review Dataset](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/).
